# The Second Battle of Ypres

A roleplaying game by Lennie Lenford and Orde Sunders

## Synopsis 

It is 2015 and so far I have seen little real rememberance and understanding of the First World War, what there has been is weak and sentimental. There began with an attempts in some quarters to reseurect the mantra of King and Country but this was met with utter contempt but what it has meant is almost a truce where no real rememberance has taken place just incase the King and Country try they revisionism.

So I am taking the opportunity at our biannual geekend to do my bit. Our neet up will be in March 2015 so we will set the game approx imatly 100 years before at the Second Battle of Ypres, where the German army first ues gas on the Western Frount.

Because this is a roleplaying game we can to play a little with reality. The game will focus on a platoon caught in heavy action near the village of St. Julien but something unusual will happen to the platoon.

## Structure of the Game

### The Plege

'Time: 3/5th.'

This is the set up, the bulk of the game will be here. The most important part is to get the feel for the characters. 



### The Turn

'Time: 1/5th.'

Something is wrong, the platoon doesn't die. At first it will seem like luck but after awhile it will start to become rediculous. 


### The Prestige

'Time: < 1/5th.'
