# Background 
 
After the assaination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian throne, and Austria's subsiquent invasion of Serbia the alliances of the great powers one by one conspired to bring Europe to war. By August 1914 Germany had fully mobilised and had invaded Belgium in order to outflank the French army, bringing Britain into the war in defence of Belgian's neutrality.

Germany's attempts to wheel through Belgium and attack the French in the rear was delayed by French, who after initial dificulties had finally mobilised, and the newly arrived British Expiditionary Force.  The Franco-British force was driven back by the Germans allowing them to capture large parts of northern France and most of Belgium. But French and British rearguard action delayed the German advance finally haling it at Marne. 

Next there were a series of operations by each side to outflank the other. Through September into October the opposing armies moved through Picardy and Flanders to the North Sea coast. 

As the armys moved they left behind crude trench systems which now streached from the Swiss frontier to the North Sea. Belgian forces hold onto a small part of Belgian Flanders alsong the Yser River. In October the BEF was transfered to south of the Belgian sector, to shorted lines of communication with England and defend the Channel Ports. 

After both sides had susceeded in securing their flanks they looked to advance through Flanders. A series of brutal and futile encounters neither side possessed forces to ensure a decisive victory and bother were exahusted , short of ammunition and suffereing from collapses in morale. In addition the new industrial warfare proved to have tipped the balance decisivly in favour of defensive warfare. 

The end of the year saw the BEF dug in defending a 20 mile section of the front centred around the Ypres Salient. 1915 saw two different attempts at breaking the deadlock of the defencive war. First British and Indian forces renew the offensive at Neuve Chapelle but after initial success were helted. Second saw the use of mines and over 53 thousand pounds of explosives to destroy the garrison position on a hill, known ad Hill 60, which over looked the Ypres salient.
