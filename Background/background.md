# Background 
 
After the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian throne, and Austria's subsequent invasion of Serbia the network of alliances one by one brought Europe's great powers to war. By August 1914 Germany had fully mobilised and invading Belgium in order to outflank the French army; bringing Britain into the war in defence of Belgian's neutrality.

Germany's attempts to wheel through Belgium and attack the French army in the rear were delayed by French (who after initial difficulties had finally mobilised) and the newly arrived British Expeditionary Force.  The Franco-British force was driven back by the Germans allowing them to capture large parts of northern France and most of Belgium. French and British rearguard action delayed the advance, finally halting it at Marne. 

Next  came a series of operations, which saw each side trying to outflank the other. Through September into October the opposing armies moved through Picardy and Flanders to the North Sea coast. 

As the armies moved they left behind crude trench systems which now stretched from the Swiss frontier to the North Sea. Belgian forces held onto a small part of Belgian Flanders along the Yser River but 95 percent of the rest of Belgium lay in German hands. In October the BEF was transferred to south of the Belgian sector, to shorted lines of communication with England and defend the Channel Ports. 

After both sides had succeeded in securing their flanks they found it now impossible to outflank the enemy so they looked to advance through Flanders. Through a series of brutal and futile encounters no advantage was gained. Decisive victory was now out of reach and both sides were exhausted, short of ammunition and suffering from collapses in morale. The new industrial warfare proved to have tipped the balance decisively in favour of defense. The end of the year saw the BEF dug in defending a 20 mile section of the front centred around the Ypres Salient. 

1915 saw two different attempts at breaking the deadlock of the defensive war. First British and Indian forces renewed the offensive at Neuve Chapelle but after initial success were halted. Second saw the use of mines and over 53 thousand pounds of explosives to destroy the German garrison positioned on Hill 60 over looking the Ypres salient. 

The promise of quick victory was at an end and the elites and populace on both sides began to settle into the brutal reality of a new form of warfare.
