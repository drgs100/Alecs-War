# Act Two

## Event Eight - New attack. 

New wave of attack, more death. This is where it starts to go strange. Events from the wrong time keep happening, at least a couple of the soldiers will follow a tank, the Germans use a flame thrower, even some British use of gas. (In the end these techniques did not feel right, the players were bought in enough that adding out of time and other wirednesses would have upset the balance.)

## Event Nine - Withdraw back through Ypres

Section is relived and they march back through the wastelands. The destruction of Ypres and all surrounding countryside is evident.
