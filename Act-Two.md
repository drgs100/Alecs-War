# Act Two

## Event xx - New attack. 

New wave of attack, more death. This is where it starts to go strange. Events from the wrong time keep happening, at least a couple of the soldiers will follow a tank, the Germans use a flame thrower, even some British use of gas. 

## Event xx - Withdraw back through Ypres

Section is relived and they march back through the wastelands. The destruction of Ypres and all surrounding countryside.
