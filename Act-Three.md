# Act Three

The unit is resting in the Belgian village of St Julien after taking heavy causalities in combat on Hill 60. The unit is a remnants of machine gun detachment of the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (KOYLI) made up of veterans of the race to the sea and some new bodies. Most of the rest of their company has been wiped out. 

## Event One - New recruits (Orde takes over to run it again) 

The Major brings two new gunners to the Lieutenant and tells him he will have get ready to relieve a section soon. 

## Event Two - Head to the Front

Head to the front through plenty of fire. Unit gets pinned by sniper fire whilst trying to make it to the trench, have to extracte themselves. 

## Take players out one by one and give them new characters, except the last player who died. 

I have no idea how the players will deal with this or how to bring it to an end.
