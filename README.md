# Alec's War

A roleplaying game by Lennie Lenford and Orde Sunders

## Synopsis 

It is 2015 and so far I have seen little real rememberance and understanding of the First World War, what there has been is weak and sentimental. There began with an attempts in some quarters to resurrect the mantra of King and Country but this was met with utter contempt but what it has meant is almost a truce where no real rememberance has taken place just incase the King and Country try they revisionism.

So I am taking the opportunity at our biannual geekend to do my bit. Our neet up will be in March 2015 so we will set the game approx imatly 100 years before at the Second Battle of Ypres, where the German army first ues gas on the Western Frount.

Because this is a roleplaying game we can to play a little with reality. The game will focus on a section caught in heavy action near the village of St. Julien but something unusual will happen to the platoon.

## Structure of the Game

### The Plege (Act One)

'Time: 3/5th.'

This is the set up, the bulk of the game will be here. The most important part is to get the feel for the characters. 

Two groups, first are experienced, some taking parting in the race to the sea other joing more recently. The second group will be the new recruits, Kitchener's Army, and it will be the Leuitennants job to bring them up to speed. 

* Gas attach. Including the roumours, and the acrid taste and the hellish appearance. 
* Digging gun emplacement and helping dig trenches. 


### The Turn (Act Two)

'Time: 1/5th.'

Something is wrong, the platoon doesn't die. At first it will seem like luck but after awhile it will start to become rediculous. 


### The Prestige (Act Three)

The hospital. We find out who the protagonist is, we find that the rest of the platoon are just figments or ghosts. 

'Time: < 1/5th.'
