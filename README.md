# Alec's War

A roleplaying game by Lennie Lenford and Orde Sunders

## Synopsis 

It is 2015 and so far I have seen little real remembrance and understanding of the First World War, what there has been is weak and sentimental. There began with an attempts in some quarters to resurrect the mantra of King and Country. This was met with utter contempt but what it has meant is almost a truce where no real remembrance has taken place just in-case the King and Country crowd try they revisionism.

So I am taking the opportunity at our biannual geekend to do my bit. Our meet up will be in March 2015 so we will set the game approximately 100 years before at the Second Battle of Ypres, where the German army first used gas on the Western Front.

Because this is a roleplaying game we can to play a little with reality. The game will focus on a section caught in heavy action near the village of St. Julien but something unusual will happen to the platoon.

## Structure of the Game

### The Pledge (Act One)

*Time: 3/5th.*

This is the set up, the bulk of the game will be here. The most important part is to get the feel for the characters. 

Two groups, first are experienced, some taking parting in the race to the sea other joining more recently. The second group will be the new recruits, Kitchener's Army, and it will be the Lieutenant's job to bring them up to speed. 

* Gas attach. Including the rumours, and the acrid taste and the hellish appearance. 
* Digging gun emplacement and helping dig trenches. 


### The Turn (Act Two)

*Time: 1/5th.*

Something is wrong, the platoon doesn't die. At first it will seem like luck but after awhile it will start to become ridiculous. 


### The Prestige (Act Three)

The hospital. We find out who the protagonist is, we find that the rest of the platoon are just figments or ghosts. 

*Time: 1/5th.*
